Histones are proteins that package and order DNA into chromosomes. Thanks to histones, 46 chromosomes in human genome, containing about two meters of 6 x 109 base pairs, can be represented in a nucleosome that has a diameter of 10 micrometers. The structure of histones remained largely unchanged during the process of evolution, so itâ€™s safe to assume that histones were formed within the common ancestor gene pool.
